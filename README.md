Neighbourhood Help Network
Overview
The Neighbourhood Help Network is an innovative web-based platform aimed at building stronger community ties by facilitating local collaboration. It empowers individuals to connect with neighbors, making it easier to seek and offer help within their vicinity. This platform envisions a world where assistance is just a click away, fostering goodwill and resource sharing.

Whether you need to borrow a tool, find someone to tutor your child, or offer help with errands, this app makes it seamless and efficient. Users can post detailed help requests or respond to existing ones, ensuring that every need in the community finds a helping hand.

The platform is equipped with location-based filtering to ensure that users are matched with nearby posts, making interactions more practical and immediate. With optional image uploads, posts are detailed and visually informative, adding clarity to requests and offers.

Security and ease of use are at the core of the platform. The app features user authentication with options for username-password login or Google OAuth, ensuring both safety and convenience. A responsive and clean UI built using React guarantees a smooth user experience across devices.

The Neighbourhood Help Network is not just a tool; it's a step towards strengthening community bonds and creating self-sufficient neighborhoods. As we continue to develop the platform, features like real-time chat and push notifications will make the app even more dynamic and user-centric
